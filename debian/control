Description: programs that helps analyse volatile "cruft" files on your system
 cruft-ng is a program to look over your system for anything that shouldn't
 be there, but is - the so called "cruft";  or for anything
 that should be there, but isn't.
 .
 cpigs is a program that by default works like dpigs
 but for volatile data. It prints out the package with the most volatile
 data (usually apt, plocate...)
 It can also dump it's whole state into a .csv format usable for
 more in depth analysis.
 .
 Both cruft-ng and cpigs base most of their results on
 dpkg's & plocate's databases, and also use a built-in custom
 homegrown ruleset to match volatile files
 - also known as "ghost" files on .rpm based systemds -
 to the corresponding engine.
 .
 Packages wanting to document such volatile files can do so
 using dh-cruft.

Description: plugin for DebHelper to register .cruft and .purge files
 While the files listed in debian/<package>.cruft will simply be
 accounted for; the one in debian/<package>.purge will actually
 be removed in the final purge step after package removal.
