Over the last 10 years cruft(-ng) had many different purpose for me:

- learn how to maintain a Debian package

- learn some C++ (this is the first/only thing I wrote)

- peak into the innards/maintainer scripts of random packages

- file bug for runtime bugs not detected by piuparts.

  Piuparts never actually _run_ the package.
  Maybe some weird mixture of piuparts & autopkgtests could help.

- later I had to cram a Debian system in small embedded system,
  then the .csv output of "cpigs" becomes invaluable and
  can played with Jupyter or whatever.

  -> when doing thins, "cruft" becomes merely a tool
     useful to train "cpigs" with new rules.

  The "python3-pip" is one such rule: it's "at risk" files,
  all the things that will become useless when Debian
  switch to the next major Python version,
  and they should be accounted somewhere/somehow.

  So I'm undecided to simply delete this "python3-pip"
  rule because I know I will needed it again.
