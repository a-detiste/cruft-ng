.TH CRUFT 8
.SH NAME
cruft \- Check the filesystem for cruft (missing and unexplained files)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cruft [ FILE ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B cruft
is a program that goes over the Debian packaging system's database, and
compares the contents of that with the files actually on your system, and
produces a summary of the differences.
.SH OPTIONS
If a file is provided, cruft\-ng will analyze this single file
and print matching package(s) name(s).
.br
Without any option, cruft\-ng will analyze the whole system.
.SH "FILES"
A user can tune execution by providing extra configuration files:
.TP
.B /etc/cruft/ignore
Do not process paths listed in this file, this can speed-up matching.
Example values: /var/schroot/, /var/www/ ...
This will override the default
.B /usr/share/cruft/ignore
.TP
.B  /etc/cruft/filters/*
Rules (glob-patterns) similar that are similar to those built-in into
.I cruft
package.
The uppercase files are always processed, the lowercase ones are processed
when matching package is installed.
.TP
.B /etc/cruft/explain/*
Shell scripts that will print-out a list of temporary file
belonging to a package.
The uppercase files are always processed, the lowercase ones are processed
when matching package is installed.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
It is possible to get some debugging information from cruft by setting the variable
.B DEBUG.
.SH "CAVEAT"
The cleansing command
.B apt purge '~c'
should be run beforehand. Beware that this may cleanse old databases
and currently unused settings you would have liked to preserve.
